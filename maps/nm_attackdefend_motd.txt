Attack the outpost and then defend it!

To destroy the barbed wire you have to 
break the black boxes with the little 
red lights on them.  There is a black 
box on each of the five fence posts.  
Once you make it passed the two fences 
you must get into the underground area 
and clear it of all enemies.  

Then just defend your newly claimed 
outpost from the attacking badguys.
