   Your land of Giram lies in dire peril. The fate of the human race is in the balance. You are but a part of a band of brave adventurers that is staring deep into the frigid eye-sockets of Death.

   You may now choose a player class. Each must be used in concert to defeat the evil hordes. If melee carnage and baths in blood are your cup o' tea, choose the Warrior. If you prefer to slay your enemies from afar with well-aimed missiles, choose the Archer. Those with interest in the arcane and application of the magic arts should choose the Wizard. If there is a philanthropist in your soul, and you desire only to heal your comrades, choose the Cleric...

Higher levels of experience may be gained at 50, 125, and 200 experience points.
