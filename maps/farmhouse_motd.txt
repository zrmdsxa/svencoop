Get your weapons from the barn and use them 
to break into the house. Then find security 
guard Bob upstairs.  After you have met up
with Bob go look for the key to the basement 
in the backyard field.  Once the door is 
unlocked go to the basement and meet with the
scientist.  Then go to the backyard and hunt
"the king" alien.
