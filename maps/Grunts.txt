Story
Well you made it. Your jeeps park in the cover of some crates and you
jump out. This road leads to the High Security Storage area but the
military already knows you are coming. They have had time to dig in.
Blocks of cargo containers have been set up as road blocks and gun
turrets have been set. Your scouts have managed to set up some sandbags
and a turret before they were sneaked up on by a patrol. Now you need
to fight your way to the elevator to the High Security Storage Area.
Look out for your captured scouts and take them with you down the
lift with you.

Change the number to get the right difficulty. 
(1=Easy, 2=Medium, 3=Hard)

Construction

Known Bugs              : 1 misaligned texture in elevator.

			  fire on RPG. :D
Build Time              : 1 week.
Compile Time		: 3 hours.
================================================================

Installation

To play this level, extract the file "storage.bsp" into
your sierra\half-life\SvenCoop directory.
Put CFG in sierra\half-life\SvenCoop.
Place the WAD in sierra\half-life\SvenCoop directory NOT VALVE!!
Then run a multiplayer game.

================================================================

Gameplay Info
This map is an eleongated version of Marines (Comrade Zhukoyev).
I made it 'objective' based. To move onto the next area you have
to destroy or kill something. I have taken the same corridor shape
but have bent it into roughly this shape:
			    IIIII
			    I   I
			    I   II
			         I
Check the level for a better idea. The main reason for this is that
it cuts down R_Speeds and that I can make a map about 3 times bigger
than Marines. There are not too many similarities with Marines.
You don't need to get Barney and the Sci onto the lift or even rescue
them but it is there if you like keeping them alive.
================================================================

R_Speeds
The R_Speeds on this map hang at around 300 polygons but the number
of grunts has meant I have had to limit the number of players to 6.
As most servers have a limit of 6 players this shouldn't be a problem.
Things can get hairy around the fence and the tunnel.
