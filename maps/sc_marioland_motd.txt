[Svencoop in Mario Land] [Greenblock Zone]
=====================================

You are in a strange realm my friend, during the Blackmesa test
on opening a sub votex portal to xen, you were caught in an accidental 
misjump to another reality. In this reality King Bowser a lizard monster
has taken over marioland and wishes to rule your reality. King bowser has 
taken the xen monsters from their home world and changed their minds to obey 
him[Even the big monsters are under his might] Bowser has a mind controlling
machine which when he brings a xen monster to Mario Land the monsters leave
an energy signiture into the form of a hard yellowish crystal. You must destroy
these crystals before he can use them to increase his summoning power. After you 
have done this, you can expect he wont be happy, and may release his big monster 
pet onto you. To escape from this realm, you must warp from zone to zone until 
you find his mind machine, and destroy it. THEN Confront him to get back to
your own reality.

Tips:

#There are 20 crystals in all in this zone.
#Look around, most crystals are hidden from view or hard to see.
#Certain boxes if you break them can come to your aid or not.
#Work as a team.

Good luck!
