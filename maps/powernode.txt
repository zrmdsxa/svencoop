Story:

  You are the IBR infiltration team, sent on a covert operation to destroy
illegal contreband weaponry located within the Powernode complex.

Every and any one is to be treated as a threath, no matter the circumstances.
(Apart from your team mates!)

You will have a set of objectives described at the beginning of each of the
operation chapters. You may use the weaponry provided plus anything you find within
the facility.

Good luck!
