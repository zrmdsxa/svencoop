
THE BUNKER
by Kenny

Just fight your way through the secret undergorund bunker and destroy the
missiles in the last room. Easy really.

NOTES: This map CANNOT be completed by just one player. There are at least
two places where two things must be done at the same time. Having said that,
if you do find a way round these bits then please tell me.

Hints:

Read below if your having trouble.







1. The front door cant be opened so give up trying. Its why I put
all those satchel charges there.

2. Dont forget to look under the stairs.

3. To get accross the water you need at least two people to open both 
valves together, or at least within 6 seconds of each other.

4. The shortcut through the vents can only be used after shooting the
fuse box.

5. To get the last person out of the first warehouse use the crates.

6. The number for the combo lock is written down - look around for it.

7. Have fun.
