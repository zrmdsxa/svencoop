## New 1.9 stuff

## This optional variable can be used to force a certain map to load after the 
## current map ends (no matter what causes the current map to end).
## nextmap <mapname>

## This optional variable stops particular transitions from working. If nobacktrans 
## is set to "c1a1", and someone steps into a transition to that map, nothing will happen.
## nomaptrans c1a2

## This makes all friendly NPCs (Barneys and scientists) invunerable. Useful if you want the 
## players to escort a scientist across the map and don't want friendly fire to be a issue.
## Default is 1 (normal/killable). Setting it to "0" will make NPCs _completely_ invunerable.
