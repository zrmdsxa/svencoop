Sven-Coop RPG 3

	Created by the DeathBog

You approach Grylion's abominable visage. The lord of Caligation, Corrosion, and Corruption's vile stench exudes an aura of malefic malfeasance. Grylion stands between you and the liberation of Giram; slay the monstrosity, garner wealth unimaginable, and once again liberate the legendary Sword of Sarticulus.

   You may now choose a player class. Each must be used in concert to defeat the evil hordes. If melee carnage and baths in blood are your cup o' tea, choose the Warrior. If you prefer to slay your enemies from afar with well-aimed missiles, choose the Archer. Those with interest in the arcane and application of the magic arts should choose the Wizard. If there is a philanthropist in your soul, and you desire only to heal your comrades, choose the Cleric...

Good luck.
