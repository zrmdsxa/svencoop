Sven-Coop RPG 

	Created by the DeathBog

You are a member of a party of adventurers who must slay the monster-lord. Mountains, caverns, fortresses, and dungeons all stand in your way.

If you defeat the monster-lord, you will recieve an unimaginably large treasure horde and will liberate the legendary sword of Sarticulus.

By defeating particularly difficult enemies along the way, the gods will reward you with enhanced weaponry. 

Choose a class:
The long-range psionicist for precision attacks or the sword-weilding warrior for brute force.
