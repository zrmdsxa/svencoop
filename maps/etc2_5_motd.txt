Story
========

ETC finished with Freeman heading into the teleporter. Where it took him was
not revealed. ETC 2 continues from this point.

So, where did Freeman go? 

The military weren't there just to clean out the creatures. They weren't there
to remove Freeman. They weren't there to silence the innocents.

The military were there in need of information. 'Xen' was news to them. They
had to know more. The teleportation unit they uncovered was merely an
accessory allowing them to gain access to the facility. And Gordon went the
wrong way. But Gordon was not prepared for this. You couldn't be.

The military were far from stupid. If these teleporters work one way, they
work the other too. Gordon led himself back into the hands of the military.

So, the military have found their way to Xen - the creatures of Xen aren't 
keen on that. They have to stop the invasion - and you're stuck right in the 
middle.

ETC 2 begins days after Gordon was caught. The creatures of a small suburb of
Xen are prepared to invade. And so they begin. It's just as well the military
are as willing to airstrike wherever the creatures end up...
