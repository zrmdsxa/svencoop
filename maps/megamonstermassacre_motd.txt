Mega Monster Massacre
	Created by the DeathBog

   You have been manufactured and programmed to one narrow-minded but glorious end: massacre all Mega-Monsters on the ash planet CX-127! Our factory assembly line will continually reconstruct you when you are destroyed, but that doesn't mean your quest will be easy. As Mega-Monsters are massacred, barriers to which their life forces were attached will be removed. Charge through these barriers and massacre the next group of Mega-Monsters! One of our spacecraft is already stationed on another part of the planet. As soon as all Mega-Monsters are massacred, the boarding ramp will be beamed in and you may succesfully clear the atmosphere!
