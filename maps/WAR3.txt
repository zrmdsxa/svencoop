Hi all...


First of all i have to tell you that you won´t find the spy 
in War3...the reasons are that school was stressing me out in the
last time...so there was not much time for me making the map or 
studying help guides from the internet...
nevertheless i hope that you all like the map :)

I can promise this: War4 will definitly be the last War and you´ll get
the chance to kick the spy´s ass ;)
