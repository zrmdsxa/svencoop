* LEVEL DESCRIPTION *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Freeman has once again been "recruited" by the elusive and stone-faced g-man
to handle a "situation' that could prove catastrophic if not handled immediately.

It seems that a rift in the space-time continuum has allowed the minions of Xen 
to establish a stronghold inside one of the main reactor cores in the Lambda Complex.
Somehow they have figured out a way to tap directly into the complex's nuclear 
power grid. They are using this energy to continually widen the rift to allow 
more and more of the Xen inhabitants into our world.  That's bad.

Oh, did I mention that the military has been instructed to keep a lid on this
situation by eliminating ANYONE with knowledge of it? That's worse.

Its Gordon's job to establish power to the test lab, then find his way to the
reactor complex via the waste tunnels connecting the two. Once inside, he's got
to find his way to the interior cores of the reactors and shut them down. 

You'll need to keep your wits about you...
You'll need to trust your instincts...
You'll have to rely on your GUT REACTION!

Good luck Gordon.

* OTHER LEVELS BY THE AUTHOR *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None that I've had the guts to release to the demanding Half-Life and Quake community!
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS / ADDITIONAL INFORMATION *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
1. Go to your Half-Life directory (i.e. c:\sierra\half-life\ but it can be anywhere)
2. Extract the contents of reaction.zip into the folder 'half-life' making sure that 
	folder names are used (in winzip just check the box in the extract dialog 
	called 'Use Folder Names'). You should end up with a folder called reaction 
	containing the PAK file and two other folders called 'gfx' and 'media'.
3. Place your HL CD in your CDROM drive
4. Run Half-Life, and from the main menu, select 'Custom Game'
	If there is no menu entry labelled 'Custom Game', you do not have v1.0.0.9 of 
	Half-Life or later. Go update it.
5. In the Custom Game menu, select the menu item titled 'Gut Reaction'. Select it.
6. Choose 'Activate' on ther left side of the screen.
7. Exit from that menu, so you're back on the main menu.
8. Choose 'New Game', then your skill level. Rock n' Roll!


**IMPORTANT**
There are MANY instances where a crouch or crouch-jump is required. Remember this!

Also, this level has not been tested for software mode, as anyone who is really serious
about playing these games should ALREADY have a 3-D card! IF you dont have one, you're
missing the point, so GET ONE!


**ABOUT THE AUTHOR AND THIS LEVEL SET**
This is my first real level development effort.

What your about to play took me about 9 months to make...Admittedly,
I spent about half that time learning the new WC and how the HL entities, etc, work.
I would estimate that there are HUNDREDS of hours invested in this project. I had starts
and stops fooling around with WC on the tail end of Quake II, then when HL came out, 
I got serious about it. Man is there a lot to learn here!! I certainly have much respect
for all those that do this professionally.

But, seeing as I make my living as an interactive designer (http://www.digwig.com), 
I dont have the kind of time or technical background to fully grasp the subtleties 
of this craft (I had a helluva time getting those damn scripted sequences to work!). 

The bottom line is that the passion for this project consumed me like nothing ever
had before. I truly love creating an experience like this that gets people excited.
So perhaps if anyone out there feels I have the potential for doing this on a 
professional level, by all means CONTACT ME! I cant think of anything else I'd want to
do for 12-14 hours a day!
